# AndroidLibraryApp

The Android Library App is a mobile application designed to simplify library management by allowing users to create accounts, check out books, and manage their transactions. Built using Java, Kotlin, SQLite, and XML, this app provides an intuitive user experience for both library members and administrators. Users can browse available books, borrow and return them, while administrators can oversee transactions and manage book inventory.

This project demonstrates full-stack mobile development with Android Studio, showcasing database integration, UI design, and user authentication. It is an ideal solution for small libraries or personal book collections, ensuring efficient record-keeping and seamless user interaction.
